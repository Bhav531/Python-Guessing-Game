# Python-Guessing-Game

This Python program offers an engaging number guessing game where the computer randomly selects an integer between 1 and 20. The player is given six attempts to guess the correct number, receiving immediate feedback after each guess to indicate whether their input is too high or too low. The program also intelligently prevents repeated guesses from counting against the player’s limited attempts, enhancing the gameplay experience.

Designed with user interaction and error handling in mind, this project demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, random number generation, and the use of data structures like sets to track guesses. Running this program provides hands-on experience with input validation and control flow, making it an excellent exercise for developing practical Python skills.
