# Python-Guessing-Game

Number Guessing Game (Python)
Overview

This Python program implements an interactive number guessing game where the computer selects a random integer between 1 and 20. The player is granted six attempts to correctly identify the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low, along with the remaining number of attempts.

Features

Prevents repeated guesses from counting against the user’s attempt limit.

Provides clear, real-time feedback to guide the player’s guesses.

Reveals the correct number upon a successful guess or after all attempts are exhausted.

How to Run

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Save the program file and execute it in a Python environment.

Follow on-screen prompts to input your guesses.

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, users gain experience with random number generation, input handling, control flow constructs like loops and conditionals, and managing state with data structures such as sets. The program also exemplifies user-friendly interaction and error prevention techniques.
