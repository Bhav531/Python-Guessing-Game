# Python-Guessing-Game
I developed a Python guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 20. The user has six attempts to guess it, receiving feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. Repeated guesses don’t reduce attempts. The game reveals the correct number when guessed or attempts run out.
